Angry birds-esque game
- Different UI elements (birds, score)
- All mouse-based
- Animations for birds
- Damage using SendMessage
- XXX can't use dynamic rigidbodies :/

Billiards
- Mouse-based
- UI for score, balls remaining, power, etc
- Animations for balls spinning + cue hitting
- Vector math for bounces and hit direction/power
- XXX killed by dynamic rigidbody restriction

Target practice game
- Similar to angry birds idea, but with manually simulated physics
- Could be like a carnival game popping balloons
- DARTS - great idea, they would just have a trigger and be stopped upon hitting board
VVV
Darts
- Mouse-based similar to angry birds launching
- Manually simulated physics, use trigger for collision
- UI for score and darts remaining
- Animations for darts spinning in air
- Vector math for throwing direction & velocity
- Vector math to look in direction of velocity
- Lerp for UI dart counter
- Inter-object communication for score
- Title scene and game scene
- Not accurate darts scoring (2d)

Missile dodging game
- Fly a plane around dodging missiles for as long as possible
- Plane goes towards mouse cursor, maybe click for a speed boost
- UI for score/timer & missile alert
- Animation for missiles (smoke), missile alert & plane/jet
- Vector math for missiles to target & rotate towards player
- Smoothly lerp speed using a curve during a speed boost
- SendMessage for damage/destruction of plane/jet
- Possibility for powerups as well?
- Title & game scenes
