Show what the scenes will look like, describe the interaction, and identify the Unity components & script functionality required.

Identify at least three features (distinct chunks of functionality, or steps of the development) of your
scenes. For each feature, use at least one page (A4 or letter) to describe and problem-solve how to
achieve this functionality, including pseudocode and diagrams/maths/notes as required.

You will make a branch for each feature, and implement that functionality on this branch, making at least
one commit to the branch. The scenes should run without errors when you are finished with this feature
(even if it doesn’t do much yet). You will merge the branch into main before starting work on the next
feature.

Chosen: Missile Dodging Game -> MissileDodge

Features: player, missiles, missile spawner, missile warning, main menu, hud, score, missile dodge manager

Jet.cs (player)
- Goes towards cursor location
- Has a temporary speed boost on click
- Turns to face the cursor and flies forward
- Has limited number of lives
- Rigidbody2D (kinematic) for movement and collisions
- Some kind of 2D collider (maybe capsule)
- Animator for plane animations (maybe wiggles wings when turning)
- Pseudocode:
  - Variables for speed, angularSpeed, boostTime, boostCurve, boostCooldown, boostTimer,
  - (cont'd) rigidbody, targetRotation, animator, lives
  - Gather references to components in Start
  - Update target rotation and animator in Update
  - (cont'd) Check for boost in Update and update HUD
  - Rotate and move in FixedUpdate
  - Subtract life on destroy and respawn plane after a few seconds
  - End game if zero lives left

Missile.cs
- Spawned outside of screen
- Tracks towards where plane will be (predicts position)
- Turns slowly (can be out-maneuvered)
- Gains speed over time before exploding after some time
- Spawns explosion effect when blowing up (due to plane or time fuse)
- Destroys plane (and self) on collision
- Rigidbody2D for movement
- Animator for smoke and boost animations
- Collider used to detect crash
- Pseudocode:
  - Variables for speed, angularSpeed, velocityCurve, maxLifetime, lifetime,
  - (cont'd) rigidbody, targetRotation, plane, animator, explosionPrefab (overall very similar to plane)
  - ^^^ Maybe missile and plane will inherit from common base class (or composition smth)
  - Gather references to components and plane in Start
  - (cont'd) Update 'missiles spawned' count of HUD/Manager
  - Predict plane position and update target rotation in Update
  - (con't) Increment lifetime and update speeds accordingly (Destroy if max lifetime reached)
  - Rotate and move in FixedUpdate
  - Destroy self and plane in OnTriggerEnter2D with plane
  - void Explode() -> spawns explosion particles and destroys
