Show what the scenes will look like, describe the interaction, and identify the Unity components & script functionality required.

Identify at least three features (distinct chunks of functionality, or steps of the development) of your
scenes. For each feature, use at least one page (A4 or letter) to describe and problem-solve how to
achieve this functionality, including pseudocode and diagrams/maths/notes as required.

You will make a branch for each feature, and implement that functionality on this branch, making at least
one commit to the branch. The scenes should run without errors when you are finished with this feature
(even if it doesn’t do much yet). You will merge the branch into main before starting work on the next
feature.
